The classification and labeling of an asset reflect the protection needs of the information it processes, stores, or transmits. The need for protection is determined by the individuals or groups responsible for the assets of the cloud service provider, according to a uniform schema. The schema provides levels of protection for the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and authenticity protection objectives. 

Additional criterion: Logging and monitoring applications take the asset protection needs into account in order to inform the responsible stakeholder of events that could lead to a violation of the protection goals, so that the necessary measures are taken with an appropriate priority. Actions for events on assets with a higher level of protection take precedence over events on assets with a lower need for protection. 

Supplementary information about the criterion: If the cloud service provider does not make a differentiated classification of the assets, all assets are to be assigned to the highest defined protection requirement. 

Complementary customer criterion: Cloud customers can use appropriate controls to ensure that the need for protection of the information that can be processed or stored with the cloud service is adequately determined. Cloud customers can also use appropriate controls to ensure that the information processed or stored with the cloud service is protected against tampering, copying, modifying, redirecting, or deleting in accordance with its protection needs. 

Notes on continuous auditing feasibility: Yes, the classification of the assets and the determination of the need for protection should take place during the initial acquisition of the assets. Thus, the classification should also be documented in an asset management tool. The determination of the protection requirement can also be carried out in a standardized form and stored digitally. If there are changes in the classification, these should also be recorded in logs. The auditor can then automatically test whether all assets on the platform are classified and whether the classification was determined using a standardized format.

The security requirements are documented, communicated, and provided in a policy or concept according to SP-01. The security requirements for data centers are based on criteria that comply with established rules of technology. They are suitable for addressing the following risks in accordance with the applicable legal and contractual requirements: faults in planning, unauthorized access, insufficient surveillance, insufficient air conditioning, fire and smoke, water, power failure, and air ventilation and filtration. If the cloud service provider uses premises or buildings operated by third parties to provide the cloud service, the document describes which security requirements the cloud service provider places on these third parties. The appropriate and effective verification of implementation is carried out in accordance with the criteria for controlling and monitoring subcontractors (cf. SSO-01, SSO-02).

Additional criterion: The security requirements include time constraints for self-sufficient operation in the event of exceptional events (e.g., prolonged power outage, heat waves, low water in cold river water supply) and maximum tolerable utility downtime. The time limits for self-sufficient operation provide for at least 48 hours in the event of a failure of the external power supply. For self-sufficient operation during a heat period, the highest outside temperatures measured to date within a radius of at least 50 km around the locations of the premises and buildings have been determined with a safety margin of 3 K. The security requirements stipulate that the permissible operating and environmental parameters of the cooling supply must also be observed on at least five consecutive days with these outside temperatures, including the safety margin (cf. PS-06 Protection against Failure of the Supply Facilities). If water is taken from a river for air conditioning, it is determined at which water levels and water temperatures the air conditioning can be maintained for how long. The maximum tolerable downtimes of utility facilities are suitable for meeting the availability requirements contained in the service level agreement.

Basic criterion: Security requirements for premises and buildings related to the cloud service provided are based on the security objectives of the information security policy, identified protection requirements for the cloud service, and the assessment of risks to physical and environmental security. The security requirements are documented, communicated, and provided in a policy or concept according to SP-01. The security requirements for data centers are based on criteria that comply with established rules of technology. They are suitable for addressing the following risks in accordance with the applicable legal and contractual requirements: faults in planning, unauthorized access, insufficient surveillance, insufficient air conditioning, fire and smoke, water, power failure, and air ventilation and filtration. If the cloud service provider uses premises or buildings operated by third parties to provide the cloud service, the document describes which security requirements the cloud service provider places on these third parties. The appropriate and effective verification of implementation is carried out in accordance with the criteria for controlling and monitoring subcontractors (cf. SSO-01, SSO-02).

Additional criterion: The security requirements include time constraints for self-sufficient operation in the event of exceptional events (e.g., prolonged power outage, heat waves, low water in cold river water supply) and maximum tolerable utility downtime. The time limits for self-sufficient operation provide for at least 48 hours in the event of a failure of the external power supply. For self-sufficient operation during a heat period, the highest outside temperatures measured to date within a radius of at least 50 km around the locations of the premises and buildings have been determined with a safety margin of 3 K. The security requirements stipulate that the permissible operating and environmental parameters of the cooling supply must also be observed on at least five consecutive days with these outside temperatures, including the safety margin (cf. PS-06 Protection against Failure of the Supply Facilities). If water is taken from a river for air conditioning, it is determined at which water levels and water temperatures the air conditioning can be maintained for how long. The maximum tolerable downtimes of utility facilities are suitable for meeting the availability requirements contained in the service level agreement.

The cloud service provider defines guidelines for the classification, prioritization, and escalation of security incidents and creates interfaces to the incident management and business continuity management. In addition, the cloud service provider has set up a ""Computer Emergency Response Team"" (CERT), which contributes to the coordinated resolution of occurring security incidents. Customers affected by security incidents are informed in a timely and appropriate manner.

Additional Criterion: There are instructions on how to collect the data of a suspicious system conclusively in the event of a security incident. Additionally, there are analysis plans for typical security incidents and an evaluation methodology to ensure that the collected information does not lose its evidential value in any subsequent legal assessment.

Supplementary Information about the Criterion: Complementary Customer Criterion: Cloud customers ensure, through suitable controls, that they receive notifications from the cloud service provider about security incidents that affect them and that these notifications are forwarded in a timely manner to the responsible departments for handling so that an appropriate response can be triggered.

Notes on Continuous Auditing Feasibility: Partially, a continuous audit of the documented policies and instructions is not effective because they are not subject to high-frequency changes. Thus, the audit of the policies and instructions can be performed in the recurring audit. Similarly, setting up a CERT is not suitable for continuous auditing as it is an organizational body and does not require continuous monitoring. The timely communication of security incidents to affected customers can be covered by a continuous audit approach. In addition, the cloud service provider can document not only the security incidents by means of logs but also that they have been communicated to the customer via email, for example. The fact that there was communication to affected customers for every security incident can thus be evaluated automatically and continuously by the auditor. However, this procedure can be combined with the audit approach of further requirements of security incident management.","Security incident management (sim). Policy for security incident management.

Examples of system account types include individual, shared, group, system, guest, anonymous, emergency, developer, temporary, and service. Identification of authorized system users and the specification of access privileges reflect the requirements in other controls in the security plan. Users requiring administrative privileges on system accounts receive additional scrutiny by organizational personnel responsible for approving such accounts and privileged access, including system owner, mission or business owner, senior agency information security officer, or senior agency official for privacy. 

Types of accounts that organizations may wish to prohibit due to increased risk include shared, group, emergency, anonymous, temporary, and guest accounts. Where access involves personally identifiable information, security programs collaborate with the senior agency official for privacy to establish the specific conditions for group and role membership, specify authorized users, group and role membership, and access authorizations for each account, and create, adjust, or remove system accounts in accordance with organizational policies. Policies can include such information as account expiration dates or other factors that trigger the disabling of accounts. Organizations may choose to define access privileges or other attributes by account, type of account, or a combination of the two. Examples of other attributes required for authorizing access include restrictions on time of day, day of week, and point of origin. In defining other system account attributes, organizations consider system-related requirements and mission/business requirements. Failure to consider these factors could affect system availability. 

Temporary and emergency accounts are intended for short-term use. Organizations establish temporary accounts as part of normal account activation procedures when there is a need for short-term accounts without the demand for immediacy in account activation.

Information flow control regulates where information can travel within a system and between systems (in contrast to who is allowed to access the information) and without regard to subsequent accesses to that information. Flow control restrictions include blocking external traffic that claims to be from within the organization, keeping export-controlled information from being transmitted in the clear to the internet, restricting web requests that are not from the internal web proxy server, and limiting information transfers between organizations based on data structures and content. 

Transferring information between organizations may require an agreement specifying how the information flow is enforced (see ca-3). Transferring information between systems in different security or privacy domains with different security or privacy policies introduces the risk that such transfers violate one or more domain security or privacy policies. In such situations, information owners/stewards provide guidance at designated policy enforcement points between connected systems. Organizations consider mandating specific architectural solutions to enforce specific security and privacy policies. Enforcement includes prohibiting information transfers between connected systems (i.e., allowing access only), verifying write permissions before accepting information from another security or privacy domain or connected system, employing hardware mechanisms to enforce one-way information flows, and implementing trustworthy regrading mechanisms to reassess security or privacy attributes and labels. Organizations commonly employ information flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms to control the flow of information between designated sources and destinations within systems and between connected systems. Flow control is based on the characteristics of the information and/or the information path.

B. Authorize the connection of mobile devices to organizational systems.

A mobile device is a computing device that has a small form factor such that it can easily be carried by a single individual. It is designed to operate without a physical connection, possesses local, non-removable or removable data storage, and includes a self-contained power source. Mobile device functionality may also include voice communication capabilities, on-board sensors that allow the device to capture information, and/or built-in features for synchronizing local data with remote locations. Examples include smartphones and tablets. Mobile devices are typically associated with a single individual. The processing, storage, and transmission capability of the mobile device may be comparable to or merely a subset of notebook/desktop systems, depending on the nature and intended purpose of the device.

Protection and control of mobile devices are behavior or policy-based and require users to take physical action to protect and control such devices when outside of controlled areas. Controlled areas are spaces for which organizations provide physical or procedural controls to meet the requirements established for protecting information and systems. Due to the large variety of mobile devices with different characteristics and capabilities, organizational restrictions may vary for the different classes or types of such devices.

Usage restrictions and specific implementation guidance for mobile devices include:
- Configuration management
- Device identification and authentication
- Implementation of mandatory protective software
- Scanning devices for malicious code
- Updating virus protection software
- Scanning for critical software updates and patches
- Conducting primary operating system (and possibly other resident software) integrity checks
- Disabling unnecessary hardware

Usage restrictions and authorization to connect may vary among organizational systems. For example, the organization may authorize the connection of mobile devices to its network and impose a set of usage restrictions, while a system owner may withhold authorization for mobile device connection to specific applications or impose additional usage restrictions before allowing mobile device connections to a system.

438,audit and accountability,AU-02,event logging,fedramp,"a. Identify the types of events that the system is capable of logging in support of the audit function: [Assignment: organization-defined event types that the system is capable of logging]. 
b. Coordinate the event logging function with other organizational entities requiring audit-related information to guide and inform the selection criteria for events to be logged. 
c. Specify the following event types for logging within the system: [Assignment: organization-defined event types (subset of the event types defined in AU-2a.) along with the frequency of (or situation requiring) logging for each identified event type]. 
d. Provide a rationale for why the event types selected for logging are deemed to be adequate to support after-the-fact investigations of incidents. 
e. Review and update the event types selected for logging [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].

An event is an observable occurrence in a system. The types of events that require logging are those events that are significant and relevant to the security of systems and the privacy of individuals. Event logging also supports specific monitoring and auditing needs. Event types include password changes, failed logons or failed accesses related to systems, security or privacy attribute changes, administrative privilege usage, PIV credential usage, data action changes, query parameters, or external credential usage. 

In determining the set of event types that require logging, organizations consider the monitoring and auditing appropriate for each of the controls to be implemented. For completeness, event logging includes all protocols that are operational and supported by the system. To balance monitoring and auditing requirements with other system needs, event logging requires identifying the subset of event types that are logged at a given point in time. 

For example, organizations may determine that systems need the capability to log every file access successful and unsuccessful, but not activate that capability except for specific circumstances due to the potential burden on system performance. The types of events that organizations desire to be logged may change. Reviewing and updating the set of logged events is necessary to help ensure that the events remain relevant and continue to support the needs of the organization. 

Organizations consider how the types of logging events can reveal information about individuals that may give rise to privacy risk and how best to mitigate such risks. For example, there is the potential to reveal personally identifiable information in the audit trail, especially if the logging event is based on patterns or time of usage. Event logging requirements, including the need to log specific event types, may be referenced in other controls and control enhancements. These include AC-2(4), AC-3(10), AC-6(9), AC-17(1), CM-3f, CM-5(1), IA-3(3)(b), MA-4(1), MP-4(2), PE-3, PM-21, PT-7, RA-8, SC-7(9), SC-7(15), SI-3(8), SI-4(22), SI-7(8), and SI-10(1). 

Organizations include event types that are required by applicable laws, executive orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines. Audit records can be generated at various levels, including at the packet level as information traverses the network. Selecting the appropriate level of event logging is an important part of a monitoring and auditing capability and can identify the root causes of problems. When defining event types, organizations consider the logging necessary to cover related event types, such as the steps in distributed, transaction-based processes, and the actions that occur in service-oriented architectures.","Audit and accountability.

466,security assessment and authorization,CA-02 (01),control assessments | independent assessors,fedramp,"Employ independent assessors or assessment teams to conduct control assessments. Independent assessors or assessment teams are individuals or groups who conduct impartial assessments of systems. Impartiality means that assessors are free from any perceived or actual conflicts of interest regarding the development, operation, sustainment, or management of the systems under assessment or the determination of control effectiveness. To achieve impartiality, assessors do not create a mutual or conflicting interest with the organizations where the assessments are being conducted, assess their own work, act as management or employees of the organizations they are serving, or place themselves in positions of advocacy for the organizations acquiring their services.

Independent assessments can be obtained from elements within organizations or be contracted to public or private sector entities outside of organizations. Authorizing officials determine the required level of independence based on the security categories of systems and/or the risk to organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals. Authorizing officials also determine if the level of assessor independence provides sufficient assurance that the results are sound and can be used to make credible, risk-based decisions. Assessor independence determination includes whether contracted assessment services have sufficient independence, such as when system owners are not directly involved in contracting processes or cannot influence the impartiality of the assessors conducting the assessments.

During the system design and development phase, having independent assessors is analogous to having independent SMEs involved in design reviews. When organizations that own the systems are small or the structures of the organizations require that assessments be conducted by individuals that are in the developmental, operational, or management chain of the system owners, independence in assessment processes can be achieved by ensuring that assessment results are carefully reviewed and analyzed by independent teams of experts to validate the completeness, accuracy, integrity, and reliability of the results. Assessments performed for purposes other than to support authorization decisions are more likely to be usable for such decisions when performed by assessors with sufficient independence, thereby reducing the need to repeat assessments.","Security assessment and authorization.

Contingency planning for systems is part of an overall program for achieving continuity of operations for organizational mission and business functions. Contingency planning addresses system restoration and implementation of alternative mission or business processes when systems are compromised or breached. Contingency planning is considered throughout the system development life cycle and is a fundamental part of the system design. Systems can be designed for redundancy, to provide backup capabilities, and for resilience. 

Contingency plans reflect the degree of restoration required for organizational systems since not all systems need to fully recover to achieve the level of continuity of operations desired. System recovery objectives reflect applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, guidelines, organizational risk tolerance, and system impact level. Actions addressed in contingency plans include orderly system degradation, system shutdown, fallback to a manual mode, alternate information flows, and operating in modes reserved for when systems are under attack. 

By coordinating contingency planning with incident handling activities, organizations ensure that the necessary planning activities are in place and activated in the event of an incident. Organizations consider whether continuity of operations during an incident conflicts with the capability to automatically disable the system, as specified in IR-4 (5). Incident response planning is part of contingency planning for organizations and is addressed in the IR (incident response) family.","Contingency planning. Contingency plan. A.

Contingency planning for systems is part of an overall program for achieving continuity of operations for organizational mission and business functions. Contingency planning addresses system restoration and implementation of alternative mission or business processes when systems are compromised or breached. Contingency planning is considered throughout the system development life cycle and is a fundamental part of the system design. Systems can be designed for redundancy, to provide backup capabilities, and for resilience. 

Contingency plans reflect the degree of restoration required for organizational systems since not all systems need to fully recover to achieve the level of continuity of operations desired. System recovery objectives reflect applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, guidelines, organizational risk tolerance, and system impact level. Actions addressed in contingency plans include orderly system degradation, system shutdown, fallback to a manual mode, alternate information flows, and operating in modes reserved for when systems are under attack. 

By coordinating contingency planning with incident handling activities, organizations ensure that the necessary planning activities are in place and activated in the event of an incident. Organizations consider whether continuity of operations during an incident conflicts with the capability to automatically disable the system, as specified in IR-4 (5). Incident response planning is part of contingency planning for organizations and is addressed in the IR (incident response) family."

The control documentation describes how system-specific and hybrid controls are implemented and the plans and expectations regarding the functionality of the system. System security and privacy plans can also be used in the design and development of systems in support of life cycle-based security and privacy engineering processes.

The security and privacy architectures at the system level are consistent with the organization-wide security and privacy architectures described in PM-7, which are integral to and developed as part of the enterprise architecture. The architectures include an architectural description, the allocation of security and privacy functionality (including controls), security- and privacy-related information for external interfaces, information being exchanged across the interfaces, and the protection mechanisms associated with each interface. The architectures can also include other information, such as user roles and the access privileges assigned to each role, security and privacy requirements, types of information processed, stored, and transmitted by the system, supply chain risk management requirements, restoration priorities of information and system services, and other protection needs. 

SP 800-160-1 provides guidance on the use of security architectures as part of the system development life cycle process. 
OMB M-19-03 requires the use of the systems security engineering concepts described in SP 800-160-1 for high-value assets. 

Security and privacy architectures are reviewed and updated throughout the system development life cycle, from analysis of alternatives through review of the proposed architecture in the RFP responses to the design reviews before and during implementation (e.g., during preliminary design reviews and critical design reviews). 

In today’s modern computing architectures, it is becoming less common for organizations to control all information resources. There may be key dependencies on external information services and service providers. Describing such dependencies in the security and privacy architectures is necessary for developing a comprehensive mission and business protection strategy. 

Establishing, developing, documenting, and maintaining under configuration control a baseline configuration for organizational systems is critical to implementing and maintaining effective architectures. 

The development of the architectures is coordinated with the Senior Agency Information Security Officer and the Senior Agency Official for Privacy to ensure that the controls needed to support security and privacy requirements are identified and effectively implemented. 

In many circumstances, there may be no distinction between the security and privacy architecture for a system. In other circumstances, security objectives may be adequately satisfied, but privacy objectives may only be partially satisfied by the security requirements. In these cases, consideration of the privacy requirements needed to achieve satisfaction will result in a distinct privacy architecture. The documentation, however, may simply reflect the combined architectures. 

PL-8 is primarily directed at organizations to ensure that architectures are developed for the system and, moreover, that the architectures are integrated with or tightly coupled to the enterprise architecture. In contrast, SA-17 is primarily directed at the external information technology product and system developers and integrators.

Personnel security policy and procedures for the controls in the PS family are implemented within systems and organizations. The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate on their development.

Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission level or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of organizations.

Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs, for mission/business processes, and for systems, if needed.

Position risk designations reflect Office of Personnel Management (OPM) policy and guidance. Proper position designation is the foundation of an effective and consistent suitability and personnel security program. The Position Designation System (PDS) assesses the duties and responsibilities of a position to determine the degree of potential damage to the efficiency or integrity of the service due to misconduct of an incumbent of a position and establishes the risk level of that position. 

The PDS assessment also determines if the duties and responsibilities of the position present the potential for position incumbents to bring about a material adverse effect on national security and the degree of that potential effect, which establishes the sensitivity level of a position. The results of the assessment determine what level of investigation is conducted for a position. 

Risk designations can guide and inform the types of authorizations that individuals receive when accessing organizational information and information systems. Position screening criteria include explicit information security role appointment requirements.

The security categorization of information and systems guides the frequency and comprehensiveness of vulnerability monitoring (including scans). Organizations determine the required vulnerability monitoring for system components, ensuring that the potential sources of vulnerabilities such as infrastructure components (e.g., switches, routers, guards, sensors), networked printers, scanners, and copiers are not overlooked. The capability to readily update vulnerability monitoring tools as new vulnerabilities are discovered and announced and as new scanning methods are developed helps to ensure that new vulnerabilities are not missed by employed vulnerability monitoring tools. The vulnerability monitoring tool update process helps to ensure that potential vulnerabilities in the system are identified and addressed as quickly as possible. Vulnerability monitoring and analyses for custom software may require additional approaches such as static analysis, dynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three approaches. Organizations can use these analysis approaches in source code reviews and in a variety of tools including web-based application scanners, static analysis tools, and binary analyzers. Vulnerability monitoring includes scanning for patch levels, scanning for functions, ports, protocols, and services that should not be accessible to users or devices, and scanning for flow control mechanisms that are improperly configured or operating incorrectly. Vulnerability monitoring may also include continuous vulnerability monitoring tools that use instrumentation to continuously analyze components. Instrumentation-based tools may improve accuracy and may be run throughout an organization without scanning. Vulnerability monitoring tools that facilitate interoperability include tools that are Security Content Automated Protocol (SCAP)-validated. Thus, organizations consider using scanning tools that express vulnerabilities in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming convention and that employ the Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL) to determine the presence of vulnerabilities. Sources for vulnerability information include the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) listing and the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). Control assessments such as red team exercises provide additional sources of potential vulnerabilities for which to scan. Organizations also consider using scanning tools that express vulnerability impact by the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). Vulnerability monitoring includes a channel and process for receiving reports of security vulnerabilities from the public at-large. Vulnerability disclosure programs can be as simple as publishing a monitored email address or web form that can receive reports, including notification authorizing good-faith research and disclosure of security vulnerabilities. Organizations generally expect that such research is happening with or without their authorization and can use public vulnerability disclosure channels to increase the likelihood that discovered vulnerabilities are reported directly to the organization for remediation. Organizations may also employ the use of financial incentives (also known as bug bounties) to further encourage external security researchers to report discovered vulnerabilities. Bug bounty programs can be tailored to the organization’s needs. Bounties can be operated indefinitely or over a defined period of time and can be offered to the general public or to a curated group. Organizations may run public and private bounties simultaneously and could choose to offer partially credentialed access to certain participants in order to evaluate security vulnerabilities from privileged vantage points.","Risk assessment.

Malicious code includes viruses, worms, trojan horses, and spyware. Malicious code can also be encoded in various formats contained within compressed or hidden files or hidden in files using techniques such as steganography. Malicious code can be inserted into systems in a variety of ways, including by electronic mail, the world-wide web, and portable storage devices. Malicious code insertions occur through the exploitation of system vulnerabilities. 

A variety of technologies and methods exist to limit or eliminate the effects of malicious code. Malicious code protection mechanisms include both signature- and non-signature-based technologies. Non-signature-based detection mechanisms include artificial intelligence techniques that use heuristics to detect, analyze, and describe the characteristics or behavior of malicious code and to provide controls against such code for which signatures do not yet exist or for which existing signatures may not be effective. Malicious code for which active signatures do not yet exist or may be ineffective includes polymorphic malicious code (i.e., code that changes signatures when it replicates). Non-signature-based mechanisms also include reputation-based technologies. 

In addition to the above technologies, pervasive configuration management, comprehensive software integrity controls, and anti-exploitation software may be effective in preventing the execution of unauthorized code. Malicious code may be present in commercial off-the-shelf software as well as custom-built software and could include logic bombs, backdoors, and other types of attacks that could affect organizational mission and business functions.

Internal monitoring includes the observation of events occurring within the system. Organizations monitor systems by observing audit activities in real-time or by observing other system aspects such as access patterns, characteristics of access, and other actions. The monitoring objectives guide and inform the determination of the events.

System monitoring capabilities are achieved through a variety of tools and techniques, including intrusion detection and prevention systems, malicious code protection software, scanning tools, audit record monitoring software, and network monitoring software. Depending on the security architecture, the distribution and configuration of monitoring devices may impact throughput at key internal and external boundaries as well as at other locations across a network due to the introduction of network throughput latency. If throughput management is needed, such devices are strategically located and deployed as part of an established organization-wide security architecture. Strategic locations for monitoring devices include selected perimeter locations and near key servers and server farms that support critical applications. Monitoring devices are typically employed at the managed interfaces associated with controls SC-7 and AC-17.

C. Protect the supply chain risk management plan from unauthorized disclosure and modification. 

The dependence on products, systems, and services from external providers, as well as the nature of the relationships with those providers, present an increasing level of risk to an organization. Threat actions that may increase security or privacy risks include unauthorized production, the insertion or use of counterfeits, tampering, theft, insertion of malicious software and hardware, and poor manufacturing and development practices in the supply chain. Supply chain risks can be endemic or systemic within a system element or component, a system, an organization, a sector, or the nation. 

Managing supply chain risk is a complex, multifaceted undertaking that requires a coordinated effort across an organization to build trust relationships and communicate with internal and external stakeholders. Supply chain risk management (SCRM) activities include identifying and assessing risks, determining appropriate risk response actions, developing SCRM plans to document response actions, and monitoring performance against plans. 

The SCRM plan (at the system-level) is implementation-specific, providing policy implementation, requirements, constraints, and implications. It can either be stand-alone or incorporated into system security and privacy plans. The SCRM plan addresses managing, implementation, and monitoring of SCRM controls and the development/sustainment of systems across the SDLC to support mission and business functions. 

Because supply chains can differ significantly across and within organizations, SCRM plans are tailored to the individual program, organizational, and operational contexts. Tailored SCRM plans provide the basis for determining whether a technology, service, system component, or system is fit for purpose, and as such, the controls need to be tailored accordingly. Tailored SCRM plans help organizations focus their resources on the most critical mission and business functions based on mission and business requirements and their risk environment. 

Supply chain risk management plans include an expression of the supply chain risk tolerance for the organization, acceptable supply chain risk mitigation strategies or controls, a process for consistently evaluating and monitoring supply chain risk, approaches for implementing and communicating the plan, a description of and justification for supply chain risk mitigation measures taken, and associated roles and responsibilities. Finally, supply chain risk management plans address requirements for developing trustworthy, secure, privacy-protective, and resilient system components and systems, including the application of the security design principles implemented as part of life cycle-based systems security engineering processes (see SA-8).","Supply chain risk management family. Supply chain risk management plan. A. Develop a plan for managing supply chain risks associated with the research and development, design, manufacturing, acquisition, delivery, integration, operations and maintenance, and disposal of the following systems, system components, or system services: [assignment: organization-defined systems, system components, or system services]. 
B. Review and update the supply chain risk management plan [assignment: organization-defined frequency] or as required, to address threat, organizational, or environmental changes. 
C. Protect the supply chain risk management plan from unauthorized disclosure and modification. 

The dependence on products, systems, and services from external providers, as well as the nature of the relationships with those providers, present an increasing level of risk to an organization. Threat actions that may increase security or privacy risks include unauthorized production, the insertion or use of counterfeits, tampering, theft, insertion of malicious software and hardware, and poor manufacturing and development practices in the supply chain. Supply chain risks can be endemic or systemic within a system element or component, a system, an organization, a sector, or the nation. 

Managing supply chain risk is a complex, multifaceted undertaking that requires a coordinated effort across an organization to build trust relationships and communicate with internal and external stakeholders. Supply chain risk management (SCRM) activities include identifying and assessing risks, determining appropriate risk response actions, developing SCRM plans to document response actions, and monitoring performance against plans.
